description: "Before Adam is a historical novel by Jack London, serialized in 1906\
  \ and 1907 in Everybody's Magazine. It is the story of a man who dreams he lives\
  \ the life of an early hominid Australopithecine.\nThe story offers an early view\
  \ of human evolution. The majority of the story is told through the eyes of the\
  \ man's hominid alter ego, one of the Cave People. In addition to the Cave People,\
  \ there are the more advanced Fire People, and the more animal-like Tree People.\n\
  Other characters include the hominid's father, a love interest, and Red-Eye, a fierce\
  \ \"atavism\" that perpetually terrorizes the Cave People. A sabre-cat also plays\
  \ a role in the story.\nThe US copyright on Before Adam has expired, and the story\
  \ is available on Project Gutenberg.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
